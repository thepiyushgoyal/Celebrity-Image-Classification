# Celebrity-Image-Classification

## Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning-based image classifier capable of identifying five distinct celebrity images with high accuracy. The classifier is integrated into a dynamic web application for seamless prediction and interaction.

### Key Features

- **Machine Learning Model**:
  Designed and trained a model to classify images of five celebrities with high accuracy.

- **Web Application**:
  Built using Flask for the backend, enabling smooth integration of the ML model for predictions.

- **User-Friendly Interface**:
  Developed a responsive front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to easily upload images and view predictions.

### How It Works

1. **Image Upload**:
   Users can upload an image via the web interface.

2. **Prediction**:
   The uploaded image is processed by the machine learning model to identify the celebrity.

3. **Results Display**:
   The prediction result is displayed along with the probability scores for each celebrity class.

### Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning**:
  - Model Training: TensorFlow/Keras (or specify the framework used)
  - Dataset: (Specify the dataset if applicable)

- **Backend**:
  - Flask (Python)

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Celebrity-Image-Classification.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Celebrity-Image-Classification
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to use the application.

### Sample Interface

Below is an example of the web application interface:

- Users upload an image.
- The classifier provides predictions along with probability scores.

### Future Improvements

- Expand the dataset to include more celebrities.
- Improve model accuracy by fine-tuning hyperparameters or exploring advanced architectures.
- Add support for additional image formats.
- Deploy the application using cloud services for better scalability.
